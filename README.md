# aalto-fitness-homepage
The first version of the Aalto Fitness homepage built with Django.

You can still see the site live at http://aalto-fitness.herokuapp.com/ (Oh and be patient, Heroku powers to site down in their free plan if it hasn't been used in a while and it takes some 10+ seconds to fire up the instance)

The current version of the site, live at aalto-fitness.ayy.fi, now uses Wordpress as it's easier to update for the majority of users who don't know HTML and CSS :)
